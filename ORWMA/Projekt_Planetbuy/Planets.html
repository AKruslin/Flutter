            <div>
               <h2>Glorious Ralila</h2>
                <p class="extraPlanets">
                    The planet Ralia, which is a temporary placeholder name, is a desert planet in a small solar system with seven other planets. <br>
                    Ralia is about 5.6 times bigger than Earth and its gravity is about 2.91 times that of Earth. <br>
                    A single day lasts 30.54 hours and a year lasts 333 days. The planet is made up of 14 continents, which make up 44% of the planet's landmass. <br>
                    Ralia itself orbits a yellow sun in a slightly elliptic orbit. <br>
                    The plant-like organisms on this planet are primarily shrubs and smaller trees, supported by small flowers, grasses and fungi on the bottom layer. Tall trees make up only a small portion of plant life on this planet. <br>
                    These organisms may not be much more than the very basics of life as we know it, they make gorgeous landscapes nonetheless. It makes you wonder how amazing this planet will be in even 10,000 years. <br>
                    The underwater plants are also very basic. The steps to higher, more specialized organisms are slowly being taken, but it will take thousands of years before we'll be able to see much variation in the planet's underwater life. <br>
                    While not as exciting as the animals we know on earth, this planet is home to a wide variety of insects, fish, reptiles and amphibians. While none of them have higher brain functions besides the basic needs to survive, they do show a wonderful insight into how this planet and planets in general give birth to life.

               <h2>Beautiful Istea</h2>
                <p class="extraPlanets">
                    The planet Istea, named after a famous scientist, is an ice planet in a vast solar system with twenty-four other planets. <br>
                    Istea is about 3.6 times bigger than Earth and its gravity is about 4.96 times that of Earth. <br>

                    A single day lasts 38.60 hours and a year lasts 105 days. The planet is made up of 9 continents, which make up 56% of the planet's landmass. <br>
                    2 moon(s) orbit the planet and Wormulon itself orbits a red sun in a fairly circular orbit.
                    <br>
                    The plant-like organisms on this planet are mostly tall shrubs and trees, many of which have a surprising amount of different colors. Some even have strong scents. The small amount of flowers that do exist share these characteristics, but almost all of them are tiny. While there are a good amount of fungi on this planet, most of them have little to no color, but they have the strongest scent of all organisms, most of which are horrible.
                    <br>
                    Attracting animals to help with pollination and reproduction is usually done with smells and bright colors, but most species on this planet do it a little different. Sound is by far the most preferred way to attract animals and it can lead to some of the most spectacular natural orchestras. Some species let the wind blow between specialized openings which create special sounds. Others produce sound with specialized mechanisms, usually in the form of clapping, which can be compared to how a Venus flytrap catches its prey.
                    <br>
                    Corals, or what closely resembles corals, cover the bottoms of almost every body of water, both lakes and oceans. Their beauty and the unique properties of this planet's waters make for some of the most impressive natural spectacles.
                    <br>
                    With the technology equivalent of the middle ages and the ambition equivalent of Ancient Rome, the higher species on this planet are fascinating to watch and study. While violent towards different groups, each region on this planet is rule by a well organized empire which takes care of its own. The hostility is mostly due to the hostile environment they live in. Dangerous wildlife and a lack of resources mean you have to stick together to survive. If only they would all work together for the survival of everybody, who knows what they'd be able to accomplish.
